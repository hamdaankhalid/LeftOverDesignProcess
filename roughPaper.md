# Rough thoughts and ideas belong here

- What is my goal?
  * A network of every store and every food bank's inventory on leftover, for anyone to plan their grocery trips around.
  * Yes, it's a marketplace but so what? Marketplaces can still be made, they will be hard, but it can be done. Food bank will get users, users will attract grocery chains.

- My MVP is kind of ugly, but it does what stores want should I ship them something for now and keep developing a better iteration?

- Notification systems for sms cost money, I could just use SMTP for email....idk about this.

- How do we deal with UI design ?
