# Introduction:
LeftOver.one is a multisided platform for foodbanks and budget constrained users.
Users can subscribe to multiple food banks, set alerts, be notified for items, search and filter available inventory, and be notified in real time.
Food Banks can publish, update , delete, and re-publish items. Food banks can also see statistics on their subscribed users, and data on what items are searched by their users.

# Decision:
- Monolith, I need to develop and ship fast.
- React.js front-end
- Backend with Rails
- Postgres Database
- SNS for messaging
